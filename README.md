# SonicAdventure2EmblemCounter
A basic emblem counter for Sonic Adventure 2 (Steam).

Attaches to the SA2 process memory (read only), reads the emblem count and outputs it to a local "emblems.txt" file next to the executable.

This can then be read into Streamlabs etc to display on screen.

Output is pre-formatted as "Emblems: 180"
